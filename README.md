# GameOfLife

This is an IOS game:

There is a grid of cells. A cell is either alive or dead. If a cell has less than two live neighbors, it dies. If it has more than three neighbors, it dies. If a live cell has exactly two or three neighbors, it stays alive and if a dead cell has exactly three neighbors, it comes to life.
